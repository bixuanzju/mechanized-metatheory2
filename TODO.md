- prove some consequnces of f_unary for existential types
- add f_binary
- prove f_binary sound for contextual equivalence
- prove some consequnces of f_binary for existential types
- do step-indexed versions of all these models (won't prove termination, but semantic safety)
- do a language first-order state
- in a binary model of a language with state, prove some nontrivial equivalences
- do a language with recursive types
- do a language with concurrency
